# Neural Network Visualizer

An interactive tool to visualize forward propagation in neural networks. Runs in the browser.

## Demo

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df09e123-b5db-4fdb-bf1f-74ef1bbd26f1

## Features

- Adjust hidden layers (1-5) and neurons per layer (2-12)
- Choose activation function (Tanh, ReLU, Sigmoid, Linear)
- Watch the forward pass animate layer by layer
- Hover over neurons and connections to see values and weights
- Randomize weights with one click

## Usage

Open `index.html` in your browser. No setup required.

## How it works

The network is fully connected. Green means positive values, red means negative. Line thickness shows weight strength. Click "Run Forward Pass" to see data flow through the network.
